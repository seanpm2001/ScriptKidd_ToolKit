### Java projects unavailable

There are some Java projects that are missing, but it is so frustrating, time consuming, and painful to upload Eclipse data to GitHub, especially with the limitation of not being able to upload to a directory that has a `.` at the beginning, or any directory before it has a `.` at the beginning. Bug me enough and I will begin to add in Java data. I should get to it eventually.
