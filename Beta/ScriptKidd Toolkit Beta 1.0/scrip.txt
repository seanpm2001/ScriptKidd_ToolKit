I am really sorry, but I was unable to put out an update today. I got burnt out of site development and I have been devoting more time to other projects
Version number update info
scheduling
the site has daily updates, here is the version number schedule:
Saturday - Version #.0 update
Sunday - Version #.1 update
Monday - Version #.2 update
Tuesday - Version #.3 update
Wednesday - Version #.4 update
Thursday - Version #.5 update
Friday - Version #.6 update
# = the 2nd decimal value in the site version
example: #.##.2
if # = 1 and ## = 27
then the example means: 1.27.2
This schedule info has been included in all updates since July 16th 2018
